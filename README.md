Sure, here's a README file for your Python script:

# UDP Communication Script

This Python script is a simple implementation of UDP (User Datagram Protocol) communication. It allows you to send and receive messages over a network using the UDP protocol.

## How to Use

1. Run the script.
2. When prompted, enter the destination IP address and port number.
3. The script will bind a socket to your machine's IP address (`100.64.7.1`) and the specified port number.
4. It will then send a message saying 'Hello, I am Windows, using UDP!' to the specified destination.
5. The script will then enter a loop where it waits for incoming messages and allows you to send messages.

## Features

- **UDP Communication**: This script uses Python's `socket` library to implement UDP communication.
- **Message Sending and Receiving**: The script can send and receive messages over the network.
- **User Interaction**: The script prompts the user for input and displays received messages.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- A network connection

## Note

Please ensure that the port number entered is an integer. If a non-integer value is entered, the script will print an error message and exit.

## Disclaimer

This script does not implement any form of encryption or security measures. It is recommended to use it in a secure and private network.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need anything else.
